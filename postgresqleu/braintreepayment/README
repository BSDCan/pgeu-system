This directory contains the braintree payment implementation.

Unlike other payment implementation, this one is not enabled
by default, because it relies on an external library.

To enable and use the implementation, set the following
paramters in local_settings.py:

ENABLE_BRAINTREE=True
BRAINTREE_NOTIFICATION_RECEIVER='someone@somewhere.com'
BRAINTREE_SANDBOX=False # Or true for sandbox testing of course
BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID='<from braintree>'
BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY='<from baintree>'
BRAINTREE_PRIVATEKEY='<from braintree>'

For automatic accounting, also set/override:
ACCOUNTING_BRAINTREE_AUTHORIZED_ACCOUNT=1621
ACCOUNTING_BRAINTREE_PAYABLE_ACCOUNT=1623
ACCOUNTING_BRAINTREE_PAYOUT_ACCOUNT=1930
ACCOUNTING_BRAINTREE_FEE_ACCOUNT=6040
