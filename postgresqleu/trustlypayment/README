This directory contains the Trustly payment implementation

To enable and use this implementation, set the following parameters
in local_settings.py (obviously changed for production keys)

ENABLE_TRUSTLY=True
TRUSTLY_APIBASE="https://test.trustly.com"
TRUSTLY_NOTIFICATION_RECEIVER="treasurer@postgresql.eu"
TRUSTLY_USER="someuser"
TRUSTLY_PASSWORD="supertopsecret"
TRUSTLY_COUNTRIES=["country1","country2"]


Put the keys in trustly_public.pem and trustly_private.pem in the same
directory as local_settings.py is located.

The TRUSTLY_COUNTRIES setting is only used for display purposes. The
actual countries where Trustly is available in is controlled from the
Trustly side (and is unfortunately not available from the API).

Currently PostgreSQL Europe has a deal which makes all transactions
through Trustly be completely free. For this reason, no fee accounting
is supported at all in the code. Should we need to support fees at
some point, actual accounting support for it needs to be implemented.
