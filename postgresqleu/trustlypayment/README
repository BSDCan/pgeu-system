This directory contains the Trustly payment implementation

Currently PostgreSQL Europe has a deal which makes all transactions
through Trustly be completely free. For this reason, no fee accounting
is supported at all in the code. Should we need to support fees at
some point, actual accounting support for it needs to be implemented.
