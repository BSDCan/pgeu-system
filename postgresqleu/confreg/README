Some minor notes about the confreg system.

Conference skinning
===================
By default all conference pages are rendered in the standard template. There is, however,
the ability to override certain things, which is configured by fields in the conference
model.

basetemplate
------------
All conference templates inherit from this template. This template must contain a block named
"content", within which all the data goes. It must also contain a block called "extrahead" where
things like javascript and CSS can be appended.

templatemodule
--------------
This is a Python module that lets the conference override what goes in the context that is handed
to the template. Typically used to randomize sponsor order and such things. Set to a full path
to a directory containing a file called "templateextra", which must contain a function named
"context_template_additions". This function will be called, with no arguments, for each page
being rendered, and must return a dictionary that is merged with the current context.

tempalteoverridedir
-------------------
Setting this will make the system search for templates in this directory first, before falling
back to the regular template loader. For more advanced layouts, this allows the complete overriding
of individual templates. Typically useful for things like the forms. Start from a copy of the
existing template, and know that this might break if major changes are made to the structure...
All templates names are of the format confreg/<nnn>, so there should always be a subdirectory
named "confreg" in the directory configured here.

templatemediabase
-----------------
This is a directory where media files for this template will be loaded. Typically this will be
/ext/<something>/. We always want to load this from the same hostname as the forms etc, in order
to avoid SSL errors when the main website is on http and the forms are on https.
