Hello!

You were recently sent an invoice from PostgreSQL Europe:

This invoice was due for payment on {{invoice.duedate|date:"Y-m-d"}}, and
we have not yet registered a payment from you.
{%if invoice.canceltime%}
If payment for this invoice has not been received by
{{invoice.canceltime|date:"Y-m-d H:i"}}, this invoice will automatically be
canceled.
{%endif%}
If you have recently paid this invoice with a bank transfer then
we haven't received the payment yet due to processing delays at
the banks which is outside of our control. Once the payment is
received you will get a receipt via email. Please contact your
bank and us at treasurer@postgresql.eu in case this is taking
too long.

If you feel this invoice was sent in error, or if there there is
any other reason you have not been able to pay this invoice, please
let us know at treasurer@postgresql.eu as soon as possible.

Please view the attached invoice for details.
