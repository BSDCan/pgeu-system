<h1>About PostgreSQL Europe</h1>

<p>
PostgreSQL Europe is an "umbrella group" for all user groups in Europe.
Our ideas is that all the PostgreSQL national European groups have
somehow the same needs and must share their experiences, but also
their resources. This way, we will help each other to grow, and all
newcomers to set up their own national PostgreSQL users group.
