<p>The first GA, which happened on January, 19th, 2015, didn't meet the quorum. These minutes is for the second GA meeting. As such, no quorum is needed. Thus, the meeting is valid.</p>

<p>Magnus Hagander is the president of the GA meeting, Guillaume Lelarge is the secretary.</p>

<p>Meeting starts at 21:05 (2015-01-26), on the IRC network freenode.net, channel #pgeu-ga. Language is english, the report is available in english and french.</p>

<p>
The agenda is:
<ul>
  <li>activities report for 2014,</li>
  <li>financial report for 2014,</li>
  <li>2015 potential activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activities report</h2>

<p>Magnus Hagander gave a brief summarization of the Activities report.</p>

<p>No question asked.</p>

<p>Votes: 16 voted Yes out of 17 present in the channel. The last one didn't vote.</p>

<p>Thus, the activities report is approved.</p>

<h2>Financial report</h2>

<p>Guillaume Lelarge gave a brief summarization of the Financial report.</p>

<p>Several questions were asked:</p>

* Fosdem costs us because of lower attendees? or the new venue?
** Because of the venue and because we don't take on a lot of sponsorship. The venue is always the costier part of any event.
* Is FOSDEM PGDay considered as a "prestige" event? Meaning you're OK loosing money on it?
** It has been our consideration before that we are OK to loose money on that one assuming (1) it's not too much, and (2) pgconfeu made enough profit that we don't end up draining our reserves.
* Did you say how much money the association has right now?
** It's in the report at https://www.postgresql.eu/about/ga/2015/financialreport/. It was about 108k euro, so that means we can "screw up completely" with one pgconfeu and still not end up in the red, but we can only do that once.
* There are no problem for a non profit with that amount of money?
** As long as we use it every year, nope
