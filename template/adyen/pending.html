<h1>Payment pending</h1>
<p>
Your payment is currently pending.
</p>

<p>
Your payment is currently held in pending state at our payment processor.
It will likely complete at a later time, and you will then automatically
be sent a receipt for the payment. You can also always
<a href="{{url}}">return</a> to the original page to view the status of
your invoice.
</p>

<p>
If your invoice does not complete in a few days, please contact
treasurer@postgresql.eu citing the full details of your payment for manual
verification and processing.
