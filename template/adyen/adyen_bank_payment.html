<h1>Invoice payment</h1>
{%if available%}
<p>
Our IBAN payment management is handled by our payment processing company,
Adyen. The payment should be made to their account, using the reference
and instructions received after following the link below.
</p>
<p>
Due to the asynchronous nature of IBAN transfers, they are only
allowed for invoices that are not close to their expiry time. The
following special rules apply to these payments:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Payments must be made <i>exactly</i> as instructed on the payment page.
   There is no manual handling in the process, so if the reference is incorrect,
   or if the payment is not done in full, it will not be matched by the system.</li>
 <li>Any transfer fees must be pre-paid (set for sender pays). If any fees are
   deducted from the payment, it will not match in the system, and thus fail.</li>
 <li>The payment must reach <i>our systems</i> before the invoice is canceled.
   This includes delays introduced by sending bank, receiving bank and payment
   processor. This usually requires 3-5 days, so we recommend that you initiate
   the payment as soon as possible.</li>
 <li>If any of these requirements are not fulfilled before the invoice
   is automatically canceled, the payment will be automatically
   returned to the sending account, minus transaction fees.  We
   do <i>not</i> have the ability to override this behaviour.
 </li>
</ul>
