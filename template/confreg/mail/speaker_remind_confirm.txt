Hello!

You were recently sent an email asking you to confirm
your ability to present the session{%if sessions|length > 1%}s{%endif%}:

{%for session in sessions%}{{session.title|safe}}
{%endfor%}
at {{conference}}.

This is an automated reminder that we are still waiting for
your response to this.

We realize you may not have had time to react to the initial
notification, but we wanted to make sure that you are aware
that there is action required.

As always, if you have any questions or need any further
clarifications, please let us know!

You will keep receiving a reminder once a week until you
have confirmed your session, or until we have manually
removed it if you are unable to attend.

To confirm your ability to attend, please use the link below:
