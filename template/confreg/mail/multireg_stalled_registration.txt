Hello!

We have noticed that you started a registration for multiple attendees
of {{conference}}, but it has not been completed.

We want to make sure you are aware that this registration is
not confirmed, and until it is, no seats at the conference are
reserved for you.

We suggest that you complete the registration as soon as possible,
to ensure there are still seats remaining, using the form at
To make sure you can attend the conference, we suggest you

{{sitebase}}/events/{{conference.urlname}}/register/other/

If you do not wish to receive any further reminders of this type,
please go to that same form and delete each of the individual
registrations by selecting Edit followed by Delete. This will
remove the registration completely, and you will receive no
further communications from us.

You will keep receiving a reminder at regular intervals until you
have either confirmed the registrations or canceled them.
