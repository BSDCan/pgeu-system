Hello!

We have noticed that your registration for {{conference}}
was created {{reg.created|timesince}} ago, but has not been confirmed.

We want to make sure you are aware that this registration is
not confirmed, and until it is, a seat at the conference is not
reserved for you.

To make sure you can attend the conference, we suggest you
complete the registration as soon as possible, using the form at

{{SITEBASE}}/events/register/{{conference.urlname}}/

If you do not wish to receive any further reminders of this type,
please go to that same form and click the "Cancel registration"
button at the bottom. This will remove the registration completely,
and you will receive no further communications from us.

You will keep receiving a reminder at regular intervals until you
have either confirmed your registration or canceled it.
