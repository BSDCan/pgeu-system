Your PostgreSQL Europe membership will expire in
{{member.paiduntil|timeuntil}}, on {{member.paiduntil}}.

If you wish to renew your membership, please go to

https://www.postgresql.eu/membership/

and follow the instructions there to renew your membership
by paying the membership fee.

You will receive a few reminders up until your membership expires,
and then a final notice when your membership expires. Once this
has happened, your email will automatically be removed from our
automated email systems and you will receive no further emails
from us.

Thank you for you continued support!
