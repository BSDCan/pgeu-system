Your PostgreSQL Europe membership has expired!

Should you wish to rejoin PostgreSQL Europe, you can do this
at any time by going to http://www.postgesql.eu/ and clicking
"Your membership" in the menu. As soon as you have paid the
registration fee your membership will be reactivated immediately.

We apologize for not sending you this notice earlier! Our systems
were not set up to email reminders about expiring memberships,
so the only way to find out about it was to log into the membership
page on the website, something which we realize most people had no
reason to do on a regular basis. As of now, both warnings and a
final expiry notice will be sent to all members - so if you sign
up again, you will at least be reminded next time.

Again, our apologies for this.


If you no longer wish to be a member of PostgreSQL Europe, this
will be the last notification mail you will receive. Your email
address has been removed from all automatic email systems at
this point.

Thank you for your support!

PostgreSQL Europe
