<h3>Joining this meeting</h3>
<p>
To join this meeting, you need an invite, which will be granted to you
based on the code above. To get the code, send a <i>!knock</i> message
to the meeting bot, and you will receive both instructions back and the
invite to the channel.
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Connect to the IRC network <i>irc.freenode.net</i>. Make sure you
   choose an appropriate nickname - once you have joined the channel
   our bot will not allow you to change it, so that we can properly track
   votes.</li>
 <li>Send a message to the bot <i>{{meeting.botname}}</i> with your code
   in it, like this:
   <blockquote>
     <code>
/msg {{meeting.botname}} !knock {{key.key}}
     </code>
     </blockquote>
   (Exactly how to send private messages may vary depending on IRC client,
   so see the documentation of your IRC client for details).
 </li>
 <li>Await response from the bot which will tell you how to join the
   channel.
 </li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that you will not be allowed to join the meeting unless you
perform the knock step <i>before</i> the meeting begins!
