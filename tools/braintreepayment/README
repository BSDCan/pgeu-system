There is an undocumented API from braintree that can be used
to do things in the sandbox environment. Specifically, it can
be used to immeaditely flag a payment as settled.


configure braintree, then:
>>> from braintree.testing_gateway import TestingGateway
>>> t = TestingGateway(braintree.Configuration.gateway())
>>> help(t)
