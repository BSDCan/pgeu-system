Your session <strong>{{session.title}}</strong> is currently
in state <em>pending reserve</em>. This means that the organizers
would like to keep your talk on the reserve list if possible.
</p>
<p>
Reserve list means that we'd like the ability to approve this session
any time between now and the event, in case another session has
to be canceled. This can include both early cancellations and late
ones due to for example another speaker unable to make it to the event.

Please do <em>not</em> do this until you are fully certain that
you can attend and deliver your session. For example, if you
need to clear travel budget or similar things, please do so before
you confirm the session.

<p>
As always, if you have any questions at all about your session,
don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:{{conference.contactaddr}}">contact</a>
the organizers!
