Hello!

The invoice for the multi-registration that your registration for
{{conference}} is part of has been canceled.

As a result of this, your registration has been unlocked, and
you are *not* confirmed for attendance of the event. If you
still wish to attend the event, you need to ensure that the
attendance fee is paid, either by paying it individually or
by a new multi-registration.

The cancellation may be manual, or it may have been an automatic
cancel because the invoice was not paid on time. For information
about the reason for the cancellation, you can contact the
person in charge of the multi-registration invoice, which is
{{bulk.user.first_name}} {{bulk.user.last_name}}.


If you have any questions about this registration, you can
also contact {{conference.contactaddr}}.
