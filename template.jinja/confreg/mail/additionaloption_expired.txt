Hello!

You recently made a registration for {{conference.conferencename}},
but it was never completed.

As some options for this event are getting close to being sold out,
they have been removed from your pending registration in order to
make room for others. The following option{%if optionscount != 1%}s have{%else%} has{%endif%} been removed:

{%for o in options%}{{o.name}}
{%endfor%}

If you are still interested in ordering this option, you may return
to the registration page and add this option back to your registration,
provided it has not yet sold out.

If you do that, make sure you complete the registration including payment,
as no seats are guaranteed until the process is completed.
