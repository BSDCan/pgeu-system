Hello!

You are receiving this email because you have been assigned as a "badge
scanner" for {{sponsor.displayname}} at {{conference}}.

This means you will be able to scan badges of attendees at the
conference, collecting contact data. You will of course only be able
to view the data of those attendees that have authorized the sharing
of their data.

To scan a badge you will use your regular smartphone. The system has
been tested with the most common models of smartphones, and should
hopefully work with the one you have.

For Android there is a native app available in Google Play to
download from: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.postgresql.android.conferencescanner

For both Android and iOS, there is a web app available that can also
be used for the scanning. Note that you will need to grant
the website permissions to use your camera, and depending on
smartphone model you may need to configure the camera before you scan
(for example so that it doesn't use the front-facing camera, which
some models do by default).

NOTE! Due to an unknown change in a recent update to iOS, when using
the web app from an iOS device such as an iPhone, the device must
be held in landscape mode instead of portrait for the scan to
complete correctly.

Finally, you can also scan the attendee badges directly with your browser
in the smartphone. This will work around the issue with landscape mdoe
on iPhones, but unlike the other methos to scan the badges you must be
logged in with the same account you used for your registration in order
to access them. If you choose to use this method, you scan the code
directly and do *not* use the app link below.

To access your personal scanning page, go to:

{{sitebase}}/events/sponsor/scanning/{{scanner.token}}/

If you go to this address and have the Android app installed, it will
auto-activate. If it does not, copy this URL and paste it into the
configuration of the app.

Note that this is your *personal* link, so do not share it with
others! Each person designated to perform badge scanning will have
their own personal link!

We also strongly recommend that you test the system before the
conference. You can find a code to test with at

{{sitebase}}/events/sponsor/scanning-test/
