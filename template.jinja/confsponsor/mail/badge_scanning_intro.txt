Hello!

You are receiving this email because you have been assigned as a "badge
scanner" for {{sponsor.displayname}} at {{conference}}.

This means you will be able to scan badges of attendees at the
conference, collecting contact data. You will of course only be able
to view the data of those attendees that have authorized the sharing
of their data.

To scan a badge you will use your regular smartphone. The system has
been tested with the most common models of smartphones, and should
hopefully work with the one you have.

For more information about the scanning, visit:
{{sitebase}}/events/{{conference.urlname}}/badgescan/?token={{scanner.token}}

Note that this is your *personal* link, so do not share it with
others! Each person designated to perform badge scanning will have
their own personal link!
