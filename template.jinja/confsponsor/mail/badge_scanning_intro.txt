Hello!

You are receiving this email because you have been assiged as a "badge
scanner" for {{sponsor.displayname}} at {{conference}}.

This means you will be able to scan badges of attendees at the
conference, collecting contact data. You will of course only be able
to view the data of those attendees that have authorized the sharing
of their data.

To scan a badge you will use your regular smartphone. The system has
been tested with the most common models of smartphones, and should
hopefully work with the one you have. Note that you will need to grant
the website permissions to use your camera, and depending on
smartphone model you may need to configure the camera before you scan
(for example so that it doesn't use the front-facing camera, which
some models do by default).

To access your personal scanning page, go to:

{{sitebase}}/events/sponsor/scanning/{{scanner.token}}/

Note that this is your *personal* link, so do not share it with
others! Each person designated to perform badge scanning will have
their own personal link!

We also strongly recommend that you test the system before the
conference. You can find a code to test with at

{{sitebase}}/events/sponsor/scanning/test/
