# Copying data from another conference

Most of the conference metadata can be copied over from another
conference. Normally this would be from another conference in the same
series, but it can be from any conference at all.

When copying from another conference, the process is:

1. Enter the administration dashboard for the *receiving* conference.
1. Click the button for the type of object being copied, such as
   "tracks".
1. Click "Copy *object* from other events"
1. Select the conference to copy from. The drop down will allow for any
   conference the user is an administrator of, or for superuser any
   conference at all.
1. In the list of objects, mark those objects that should be
   copied. Use the checkbox in the top right corner of the table to
   select *all* objects.
1. Fill out any transforms if there are any
1. Click "Copy *objects*"
1. If a transform was available and used, check the box to confirm
   that the transform example looks correct, and click "Copy
   *objects*" again.

## Transforms

Some objects allow for transformation during copy. In particular,
objects that include timestamps (*sessions*, *schedule slots* and
*volunteer slots*) allows a transform that adds a fixed number of
"days hours:minutes:seconds" to be added to all times, both start and
end times.
