# Conference series

A conference series represents a set of "the same" conference that
runs across multiple instances. For example, "PGConf.EU" is a series
and "PGConf.EU 2018" is an instance.

Conference series are primarily used for the
[e-mail opt-out](emails#optout) functionality and for providing
introductory information on the main website.
