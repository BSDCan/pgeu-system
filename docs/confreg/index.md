# PostgreSQL Europe Conference Management System

This is the administrative help for the PostgreSQL Europe Conference
Management System. It is aimed at the persons administering
conferences -- it is not for the developers of the system, or for the
end users.

At any point in the system, you can click the help link in the top
right corner. If there is specific documentation about the part that
you are currently working on you will be brought directly to the page
for that. If not, you will be brought here to the index page, and can
work from here.
